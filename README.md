# Accessibility Tutorials

This repository contains the code for my technical tutorials and howtos about accessibility.

- APIs and Implementation
- Testing
- Guidelines and recommendations
- Different platforms and technologies

This code is not production-ready but for demonstration purposes.
I use resources like [ARIA Authoring Practices Guide][apg] and turn them into developer-friendly and expressive git histories.
